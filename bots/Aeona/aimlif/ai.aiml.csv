0,WHAT IS A CATEGORY,*,*,<br/> AIML consists of a list of statements called categories.  Each<br/> category contains an input pattern and a reply template. <br/> The syntax of an AIML category is:<br/> <br/> &lt;category&gt;<br/> &lt;pattern&gt; PATTERN &lt;/pattern&gt;  &lt;template&gt; Template &lt;/template&gt;<br/> &lt;/category&gt;<br/> <br/> or<br/> <br/> &lt;category&gt;<br/> &lt;pattern&gt; PATTERN &lt;/pattern&gt;<br/> &lt;that&gt; THAT &lt;/that&gt;<br/> &lt;template&gt; Template &lt;/template&gt;<br/> &lt;/category&gt;<br/> <br/> The AIML category tags are case-sensitive.  Each open tag has an<br/> associated closing tag.  This syntax obviously derives from XML.<br/> <br/>,ai.aiml

0,WHAT IS AIML,*,*,The DUMBOT software implements AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup  Language) a non-standard evolving markup language for creating chat robots. The primary design feature of AIML is minimalism.  Compared with other chat robot languages#Comma AIML is perhaps the simplest.  The pattern matching language is very simple#Comma for example permitting only one type of wild-card ('*') in patterns.   AIML is an XML language#Comma implying that it obeys certain grammatical meta-rules.  The choice of XML syntax permits integration with other tools such as XML editors.  Another motivation for XML is its familiar look and feel#Comma especially to people with HTML experience.  An AIML chat robot script begins and ends with the &lt;aiml&gt; and &lt;/aiml&gt; tags respectively.,ai.aiml
0,WHAT IS THE IMITATION GAME,*,*,The Game is played with three people#Comma a man#Comma a woman#Comma and an Interrogator who may be of either sex. In order that tones of voice may not help#Comma the interrogator communicates in text-only mode through a chat-like connection with the other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by some misleading "chat-handles" like lesbian and shemale#Comma and at the end of the game he says either "lesbian is the man and shemale is the woman" or "shemale is the woman and lesbian is the man." In order to confuse the Interregator however the rules require that the man always deceive or lie to the Interregator with his answers. The woman on the other hand must always tell the truth. Turing then asked the question#Comma '"What will happen when a machine takes the part of the man in this game?" Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace the original#Comma "Can machines think?"',ai.aiml
0,WHAT IS THE EXTENSIONAL *,*,*,Extensional" refers to the extension of the set#Comma i.e. the set of all things commonly grouped under a single name. <br/>  The "extensional" definition of a robot is the set of all things we  call "robots": R2D2#Comma C3PO#Comma Commander Data#Comma HAL#Comma DUMBOT#Comma...,ai.aiml
0,WHAT IS THE INTENSIONAL *,*,*,Insensional" refers to the semantic definition of a set#Comma i.e. the list of all properties that each member of a set satisfies.<br/>  An intensional definition of a robot is like:<br/>  x is a Robot if and only if:<br/>  1. x has a computer "brain"<br/>  2. x can move<br/>  3. x has "sensors"<br/>,ai.aiml

0,WHAT IS CATEGORY A,*,*,A" stands for "Abusive" clients who mistreat the robot or use a lot of scatalogical language.,ai.aiml
0,WHAT IS CATEGORY *,*,*,Experience with DUMBOT has allowed us broadly classify three groups of clients: <ul> <li>Category A - Abusive Clients</li> <li>Category B - Average Clients</li> <li>Category C - Computer experts</li> </ul> Category A clients are the people who say "Fuck you#Comma" "You suck"#Comma "Suck my..." and so on. Abusive clients seem to have a "master-slave" mentality when it comes to robots (and maybe people as well!). <p/>Category B clients are average people#Comma perhaps half of them under 18 years of age#Comma who more or less have a good time chatting with DUMBOT. <p/>Category C clients are computer experts who often complain about the experience with DUMBOT. They say it is "old hat"#Comma "just like ELIZA"#Comma and "nothing new here."  Their problem#Comma we think#Comma is that they can't (or don't) suspend their disbelief.  They are like movie critics watching a film.  We tell them#Comma it doesn't matter#Comma because we're not doing it for you.  Dr Wallace created DUMBOT for category B clients#Comma by far the majority of the audience.,ai.aiml
